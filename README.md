## Description

Introducing  â€”â€”>  **[https://aadriien.github.io/pose-pulse](https://aadriien.github.io/pose-pulse)**  <â€”â€”  Pose Pulse! 

Do you like quick and unusual games? Do you like moving around and whacking things? This is for you!

My game, `pose-pulse`, combines computer vision and augmented reality to deliver to you an exciting and interactive experience from the comfort of your own browser. Simply navigate to the webpage, enable camera access, and get moving!


## How It Works

Your motions will be tracked by the camera and displayed on the screen, creating something like a poseable skeleton. Colorful pulsing dots of different sizes will randomly appear around you, and it's your job to hit them before they disappear. 

This game can be as simple or as complex as you make it. Whether sitting down or riding a segway (yes, a segway!), `pose-pulse` is sure to get you moving, so lean into the fun!
